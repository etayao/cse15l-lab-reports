# How to log onto your 15L account!
For this course, you have a course-specific account which can allow you to connect to the CSE basement servers.
This tutorial will show you how to log into that account on *ieng6*

## Step 1 - Starting With Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio (VS) Code is a code editor but also a way for you to access your own terminal. This terminal is where you can run commands and access the CSE basement server later on. 

1. Open the [VS Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and download and install. Use dropdown menu in the download button to find the correct version according to your operating system (e.g. Windows for PCs, macOS for Macs, etc.).

2. Once VS Code is installed, opening up VS Code should like like this.

Adding this program to your taskbar or desktop will help accessing it in the future.


## Step 2 - Remotely Connecting

Once VS Code is open, go to the top left menu (you might have to open a 3-bar icon to see these options) and click Terminal. You want to select "New Terminal" and a new terminal should appear somewhere on the VS Code application.
